	        <p>The Sand to Snow National Monument near Palm Springs, Calif., is home to wildlife including 12 federally listed threatened and endangered animal species. <strong>It's also home to a herd of at least 150 feral bulls and cows that have been destroying the ecosystem and scaring away tourists.</strong><br /><br />&quot;They are carving new trails and wiping out grasses that anchor soil against erosion,&quot; reports the Los Angeles Times. &quot;<strong>They have knocked over willows that are home to birds, including federally endangered least Bell's vireos,</strong> and contaminated the watershed with their droppings.&quot;<br /><br /><strong>The wild cattle have also been menacing to visitors.</strong> A tour guide was nearly gored in February when he was charged by one 2,000-pound bull.<br /><br />To deal with the problem, the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, which co-manage Sand to Snow, are dispatching a team that includes biologists, federal land managers and representatives from a local Indian reservation to come up with a plan. <br /><br />Although a board member of a bighorn sheep conservation group said he's all for lethal removal of the feral cattle, <strong>the plan to remove them must comply with state and federal wildlife regulations</strong>.<br /><br />Just because the feral cattle are in the wrong place at the wrong time, they should not be killed. <strong>Please sign and share this petition urging officials to relocate the wild herd to a safer and more appropriate location.</strong></p>
